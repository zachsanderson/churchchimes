# Reedsville United Methodist Steeple Chimes Project

## Background

Reedsville United Methodist is located in, if such a thing exists, the center of Reedsville, West Virginia, a rural mountain town. One of the features of the church is the steeple, right above the entrance that faces the main road. In the top of the steeple, past a row of four beautiful stained glass windows and a lot of bird crap, are some loudspeakers that at certain times of the day play recordings of chimes across the valley.

Those chimes have stopped working. My grandmother, Maxine Radabaugh, has for years served as the “matriarch” of the church and has asked me to help her fix those chimes.

## Existing Setup

The speakers for the chimes are located in the steeple. It takes a very large ladder to get to the first level of the steeple which is accessed through a trap door. There’s apparently another trap door another flight up and a rotten wooden ladder to access that door. Needless to say, I’ve only been to the first flight so I have not gotten a visual on the actual speakers. There’s apparently a receipt for these speakers but it remains at large and no one knows what’s up there. It is my hope to actually see them some time and, with some research, figure out how to get some specs on them to determine what would be the right power to send to them.

From the speakers, it appears that common household gauge power wire (12- or 14-gauge) is being used as speaker wires. This is consistent from the hole in the steeple to the back of the chime amp. The chime amp is located on the opposite side of the church. The church is essentially a one room sanctuary but relatively large. I’ve found one spot halfway between the amp and the speakers with exposed wire that could belong to the system. The wire gauge seems to match what’s located on both ends.

On the source end of the system, there is a very old, heavy box. On the box is a large clock with metal contacts for the hands to strike, which I assume is what triggers playback at certain times. There is a player for large tapes. The format is similar to an 8-track cassette but larger. There appears to be only one tape of 20 songs. The way the system is setup I believe it plays through 2 songs each time it is triggered. I’m suspecting that each song is a similar length and the trigger just runs the player and amp for the same amount of time each time. The next time it is triggered it just plays the next 2 songs on the loop. There are other controls like equalizer settings and manual overrides on the front.

## Problem Description

With this current setup, the song variety and control is very limited. Based on the age of the tape, I’m guessing the quality is pretty low as well. There’s not a lot of flexibility for playback. My uncle makes a point to manually override it every Sunday since it is set to go off at noon and occasionally would interrupt longer church services. He would then let it play as church let out. Although his attendance and participation is most likely impeccable, this “feature" relies on one point of failure.

Aside from all of the issues with a working system, the main issue is it just don’t work any more. I’ve run some very unscientific tests and it makes me think that the main issue is the internal amp is, to use a technical term, fried. I do not know much about the workings of sound equipment once you get past the input stage, but I tested a few things.

First I think I figured out how to do a manual override and get the tape to play at an unscheduled time. The lights lit up, the tape head dropped and the tape rolled. No sound.

I then found both the aux and mic input jacks on the back. I sent audio (tasteful country music in case it worked) from my phone to both inputs with no sound.

At some point I noticed there’s a speaker on the front of the cabinet and I think I was getting some sound out of it. I also borrowed some small speakers from my grandma’s storage. I assume that this amp is meant to push to much larger speakers so I started at a low volume just in case that helped in any way. I got some sound out of the speakers but was never able to affect the volume. The sound reminded me of this really old pair of powered portable speakers I had. They would still technically work passively, much like my headphones, without any batteries, but they were meant to be driven actively and, of course, sounded much better when I had my gazillion rechargeable AAs installed.

So I wouldn’t say my diagnosis is good enough to be called official but it’s what I’d put my money on: the internal amp does not work.

Regardless, based on my research, this unit was available as early as the late ‘60s. I think it’s time for an upgrade. My mom has started researching new church systems and they appear to be really expensive and elaborate. I was given the go-ahead to take a whack at it myself. I even have the old machine in my possession.

## Features

I’ve talked to my grandma, my uncle and my mom about the system and have researched other products online, but most of my ideas are based on my opinions. They are probably too strong for a man who lives 750 miles away and only gets to visit the church maybe once a year. I’d be flexible on certain features, but I think this is a good opportunity to make something unique and helpful to my grandma and her church. This was originally introduced as a possible gift for the church in honor of my great grandmother who would have been 101 this spring. My mom adored her Grandma Brown, and though I never knew her, I love hearing stories about her.

### Cost
Cost isn’t a dealbreaker on this one, within reason. The church wants it done and I bet my grandma will make sure that happens. Although my design/thoughts are somewhat cost-driven, it’s more of a “look what can be improved on for even cheaper”. I believe that’s what drives about 95% of nerds’ pursuits of things. It’s a lot more fun to use the funds to build something to your specs than spend a ton more for somebody else’s. That is of course if you can get it done.

### Timer
A new system would need the ability to run on a timer and play at reliably set times. It should be able to handle power outages and daylight saving time changes. It would ideally be flexible for dates. For example: there may be church holidays where the timing could be different. A manual override feature would be helpful for avoiding church service interruptions.

### Amplification
Although I’m making all of this up as I go along, the amplification part is the area where I’m the most green. I am not confident that the amp is not working on the existing system. I’m not certain if it would still be usable even if the playback system was updated. My first inclination is that it could stand to be replaced either way. I have no information on the speakers currently and my biggest question is how to go about figuring that out. I am looking for guidance on testing the speakers and the wire leading to them.

The system should obviously have sufficient power to drive outdoor speakers. I would like to be confident on what those requirements are for good volume and quality of sound. Right now I don’t have much to go on.

Although I’m not confident on this either, I suspect the amp spends a decent amount of power when it’s on so I’m thinking it’s best to have the amp on only when audio will be playing.

### Control
Ideally the system wouldn’t need a ton of control once it is set in place, but it would be nice to have.

Some controls might be:

- setting/adding a new song

### Feedback/Display

### Music

### Updateable
